You can now filter results AFTER you have scraped for them in Fen Light. Press left when shown results to open the filter sideblade.

You can filter results here by the quality of the result, or the provider of the result.

Or choose one of the filter types "Filter by Title" or "Filter by Extra Info"...

[B]Filter Title[/B]
- Use this to input a Keyword(s) that Fen Light will then use to search the Titles of the results. Fen Light will remove results who's title does not contain the Keyword(s).

[B]Filter Extra Info[/B]
- Use this to choose a Keyword(s) that Fen Light will then use to search the Extra Info of the results. Fen Light will remove results who's Extra Info does not contain the Keyword(s).

To remove the filter and return to displaying ALL the results, simply press "BACK".
