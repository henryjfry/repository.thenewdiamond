Discover is a feature that allows you to make custom lists using the filter values you provide. Only the filters you wish to use need to be assigned a value, the rest can be left blank. Once you've set your desired filters, select 'Save & Exit'.

Your lists can be viewed by selecting them in the Discovery sections, and can also be added to any main Fen lists by using the Edit Main Menus feature.

There are many different lists you could make using different filters, below is an example:

You want to make a list for Comedy/Action Movies made in the 1980's that are PG Rated:
- Assign a "[B]Year Start[/B]" filter of "1980"
- Assign a "[B]Year End[/B]" filter of "1989"
- Assign a "[B]Include Genres[/B]" filter of "Action, Comedy"
- Assign a "[B]Certification[/B]" filter of "PG"
Only want movies with Tom Hanks in your new list? Add a 'Tom Hanks' filter for 'Includes Cast'.
- [B]Enjoy your 1980's Action/Comedy Family Movie Night.[/B]
