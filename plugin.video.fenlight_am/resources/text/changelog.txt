[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.40[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Anime Watched, Anime Recently Watched, Anime In Progress, Anime Recently Watched Episodes, Anime In Progress Episodes & Anime Next Episodes' to the Anime section. From now, Anime will be more sectioned off into the 'Anime' section of the addon. This means watched status lists for anime will only appear in this new menu, not the 'TV Shows' instance of watched status lists. To access these new menu items, navigate to the Anime section and, from the context menu, select 'Restore Menu', which will restore the menu to default and add the new menu items.
- Added "Limit Results Per Quality" to Settings->Results->Sorting & Filtering. Set a value on this, and Fen Light will limit the results shown for each quality (4K, 1080p etc) to that value.
- Added "Limit Results Total" to Settings->Results->Sorting & Filtering. Set a value on this, and Fen Light will limit the total results shown.
- Added "Language" to Discover menu for Movies and TV Shows. Set the original language for the content you want.
- Added Custom Poster and Custom Fanart for Trakt My User Lists and Trakt Liked User Lists. Options found in the context menu.
- Fix for "finish watching at..." time reporting to show accurate data when there is a resume point on the media. For skins that show this info.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.39[/B][/COLOR]
- Icon choice will persist through custom windows.
- Fixewd In Progress Episodes not displaying when sort set to title.

- Quick fixes for Autoplay Cloud Sources.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.37[/B][/COLOR]
- Included episodes when considering hide watched items for widgets.
- Added "Autoplay Cloud Result" to each account's settings. Enable this and any cloud result found after a prescrape will be automatically played.
- Added "Avoid Episode Spoilers in Custom Windows" to Settings->Content->General. This will hide plot and thumb spoilers from FenLightAM's custom windows.
- Added "Retry With IMDb Year Data When No Results" to Settings->Results->General.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.36[/B][/COLOR]
[COLOR darkgoldenrod]Thanks for the nice Easynews playback workaround find [B]Kodifitzwell[/B].[/COLOR]
- Added Settings->Playback->Playback Utilities->"Easynews Playback Method". Use this to set a playback method to resolve Easynews links...
NONE: No special method used.
RETRY: Retries the EN link if it fails the first time (slow and doesn't work on some hardware).
NO SEEK: Tells Kodi the file is not seekable, which makes EN happy. The file will usually play first try and quickly, but you will not be able to seek forward/backward outside of the current cached data.
BOTH: Will use NO SEEK, and will also allow for RETRY. Probably not needed for most setups. But this covers all.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.35[/B][/COLOR]
- Quick fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.34[/B][/COLOR]
- Quick fixes.

- Added ability to delete RD Cloud files directly from results (in context menu).
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.31[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Retry With Cache Check Ignored When No Results" to Settings->Results->General. If set to "Auto", then if there are no cached RD/AD results it will automatically show all results as Unchecked.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.30[/B][/COLOR]
- There are now 2 easily accessible methods to toggle the state of check cache status (RD & AD) and rescrape. Either through the Playback Options context menu item or through the results sideblade.
- Fixed "random" not working as a sort for self made Discover lists.
- Other quick fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 2.1.29[/B][/COLOR]
- Added "Check for cached status of Results (RD & AD)" to Settings->Accounts->External Scrapers. Enabled by default. Enable this and Fen Light will attempt to determine the cached status of external results for Real Debrid and all Debrid. This is by no means fully accurate, and you will likely often receive less overall results than with this disabled. But if using it, all results shown are likely cached on their servers and can be played immediately (removes the "Unchecked" parameter for RD and AD results).
- Added "Toggle External Cache Check" to Playback Options so you can more easily enable or disable the new cache check.
- Added "Assign Addon Icon Image" to Settings->General->General. Use this to choose from the available addon icons shipped with Fen Light AM.
[COLOR darkgoldenrod]Big thanks to user [B]"mgudarzi"[/B] for providing some great icons.[/COLOR] Hop on to my github if you want to have icons included. Please make them 512x512, and small in filesize (50kb or less).

- Added sort ability to TMDb Lists (your personal lists from TMDb). Access in Settings->Accounts->TMDb Lists->Lists Display Sort Order.
- Changed "Custom Autoplay Sort To Top" to "Custom Sort To Top". This setting will now apply to non-autoplay results as well if chosen. These will need to be re-set.
- Simplified random widgets caching.
- Reworked custom context menu editing. You can now re-add a removed item without having to restore the context menu to default.

- [REQUEST] Added TMDb Lists to "My Lists". Authenticate your TMDb account in Settings->Accounts->TMDb Lists to access your lists. Lists will respect paginate settings. There is also a "TMDb Lists Manager" in the context menu for Movies and TV Shows. You will need to restore the context menu to default to start seeing it.
- [REQUEST] Importing into TMDb Lists a Trakt Collection/Watchlist/Personal List is possible. Importing a Liked List is NOT possible, so as to avoid abuse of TMDb's lists service. Imports will respect current sorting settings. This will NOT "link" your Trakt list to the TMDb list, it will import a "snapshot" of the list in it's current state. There is a 450 item limit on Trakt List imports. Any extra over that figure will be ignored. Please keep the TMDb lists within reason.
- [FEATURE] Importing a Trakt List to Personal Lists or TMDb Lists will now include a prompt to rename that list to the Trakt List's name.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.93[/B][/COLOR]
- Couple of quick fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.92[/B][/COLOR]
- [CONTEXT MENU->OPTIONS->ASSIGN AN EPISODE GROUP TO...] Added option for TV Shows to assign an episode group from TMDb. These episode groups cover alternate season and episode orders based on other parameters. For example, it might be possible to set the episode order for a TV Show based on it's streaming aired order, or it's order from another service such as TVDb. These Custom Episode Groups will not change how the episodes are arranged within Fen Light, rather the information from them will be used when scraping for results for playback. This feature may be particularly useful when dealing with Anime content, but can be set for any TV Show.
- Added Settings->Results->General->"Retry With Custom Episode Group When No Results". Enable this and Fen Light will rescrape using a custom episode group if no results are found. If a custom episode group is already assigned to the TV Show (above for details), then a rescrape will occur using instead the default season/episode values instead.
- Added Settings->General->General->"Limit Concurrent Threads". Use this if your device is erroring by not allowing python to start new threads once a certain threshold is reached. There is a hard limit of 60 if this is not enabled and set to a user preference. Min/max settings are 10/300.
- Temporary workaround for the RD "no cached results" error currently randomly affecting calls to check RD's cache. Will be removed once their API is fixed for this endpoint.
- Fixed "Parental Guide" in Extras window. To get fresh results (empty results are cached), clear IMDb Database and restart Kodi.
- Improved trailer choice for metadata. Clear metadata cache for benefits.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.90/91[/B][/COLOR]
- Added Settings->Results->Sorting & Filtering->"Custom Autoplay Sort To Top". This will allow you to set 5 different video/audio characteristics that you wish to see brought to the top of the sources list for autoplay. Things like "HEVC" or "DOLBY VISION" etc. These will be weighted on importance, with the higher the position in the list of 5 the higher the importance when sorting to the top.
- As a result, the other filtering options which previously featured an "INCLUDE, EXCLUDE, PREFER (AUTOPLAY)" setting have been reset, and the "PREFER (AUTOPLAY)" option has been removed.
- Other changes/fixes.

- Added "Because You Watched" section to the Random menu. This will take random media from up to the last 5 movies/episodes you have watched, select one of those at random, and display recommended media from that watched item.
- Added Settings->Content->General->"Seeds used for Because You Watched Random". Choose how much previously watched media is used for recommendations for the Because You Watched Random menu. You can choose from the previous 1 to 5 watched items as the list from which the seed will be added.
- Partial fix for Parental Guidance in Extras window. IMDb look to be in the process of changing this on their website, so if the new layout loads, it will still not work. Clear Main Cache to clear any null values for this.
- Other changes/fixes.

[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Version 1.0.83/84[/B][/COLOR]
- Added a favorites entry for Anime. All shows favorited from within the Anime section will be saved as an Anime favorite, rather than a TV Show favorite.
- Added "Anime" to the Search menu. Will exclusively search for Anime TV Shows. Can be added to the Anime section if preferred using the menu edit system.

- Added Settings->Content->General->"Watched (Still Airing) TV Shows Location". Select from "Watched", "In Progress" or "Both". This decides which menu fully watched, but still airing, TV Shows will be included in. Default is "Watched" (which is the current behavior).
- Excluded some genres from the "Popular" TV Shows list. Atleast until TMDb get that list sorted out. Clear the Lists cache to get slightly better results there.
- Other changes/fixes.

If you use "random" widgets (made using the various methods in Fen Light) then you will need to set a value here or else the random widgets will only show fresh random content on each Kodi start.
