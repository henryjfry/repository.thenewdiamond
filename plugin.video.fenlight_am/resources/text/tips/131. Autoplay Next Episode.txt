If you set 'Autoplay' in Settings-->Playback-->Playback, then you will see an 'Autoplay Next Episode' setting appear. Select that and Fen Light will fetch results for the next episode of the TV Show you are watching, and begin playing it once the current episode has ended. This is a built-in feature of Fen Light, so there is no need to install the UpNext add-on to begin your binge-watch session. Try it out to see...
