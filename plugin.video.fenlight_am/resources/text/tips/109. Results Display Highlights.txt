Fen Light allows you to choose how colors will be used to distinguish between scraper results.

Go to Settings->Results->Results Color Highlights and choose firstly your desired setting for "Highlight Results Based On".
The 3 choices are:
* PROVIDER - Highlight results based on the provider the result is for i.e. one color for Easynews, one color for Real-debrid etc.
* QUALITY - Highlight results based on the quality of the result i.e. one color for 4K, one color for 1080P etc.
* SINGLE COLOR - Highlight results using one single color for all result types.

As you change the setting above, relevant color settings will be shown for you to set as desired.
