Fen Light includes 5 'Local Media Folder' scrapers.
Choose a Movie and TV Show directory for any of these scrapers, and Fen Light will scan those directories for results. There is a small amount of leeway for how folder structures must be set out, but to assure best chances of a relevant file being found, it is best to have the following structure:
        - Movies Folder    <----Enter this into the scraper setting.
                - Movie 1 Folder
                        - movie1.file
                - Movie 2 Folder
                        - movie2.file
        - TV Shows Folder    <----Enter this into the scraper setting.
                - TV Show 1 Folder
                        - Season 1 Folder
                                - s01e01.file
                - TV Show 2 Folder
                        - Season 1 Folder
                                - s01e01.file
To Use:
Go to Settings->Accounts->'Local Media Folders'. Turn ON 'Enable'. Also set any additional settings needed here.
Select "Set Folder Scrapers", and assign Network/Local folders, giving them a label and assigning their location.

NOTE: You don't need to set both a Movie and TV Show folder for each of the Folder Scrapers, just leave which ever you don't want to use blank.
